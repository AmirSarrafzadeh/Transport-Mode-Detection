This project is done on the Geolife Dataset, which is available in the below link.

There exist 3 Separate Folders:
1) Geolife 
2) Preprocessed Data

If you do not want to run the preprocceing part of the Geolife data, and want just run the CNN model you can use the proprocessed data.


If you have any questions or if you face any problem in the project you can reach me by this email:
